This assignment tasked us with porting an existing game to a new engine as accurately as possible. The game we chose was a 2D puzzle platformer made in Godot called [Diver Down]([https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2022/games/twilight-gal-1](https://escada-games.itch.io/diver-down). We chose to port the game to Unity, and we were able to recreate it fairly accurately using the original code as our guide.
